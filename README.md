# 100 Days of Python
This repository documents my commitment to up-skilling in Python in 100 days. At the beginning of this journey, I admit that I have some foundational knowledge in Python, but I am trying to sharpen my skills with the basics, especially in the Object-Oriented programming side of the language.

## Goals
### What are my short-term goals for this learning journey?
- I want to complete the [OpenEdg Python institute's associate level course](https://pythoninstitute.org/free-python-courses/) within these 100 days.
- Achieve the [PCAP - Certified Associate in Python Programming certification](https://pythoninstitute.org/certification/pcap-certification-associate/)

### What are my long-term goals for this learning journey?
- Lay a robust foundational base in Python.
- Gain advanced knowledge in Python.
- Strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
- Gain advanced knowledge in the Pytest framework.

## Learning Resources
Some of the learning sources during this 100 days of learning journey are free, and some are not. I have listed them all. Feel free to pick whatever suits you.

I have listed the learning resources in the order I have followed.
_**TODO**: Add links to the below resources_
- Programpiz course - basics of Python
- Python course on Udemy by Jose Portilla.
- [OpenEdG Python Institute's Python Essentials Part 1 and Part 2](https://pythoninstitute.org/free-python-courses/)
- ACloudGuru's PCAP certification course
- Pytest v2 book by Brian Okken

## Resources for Practicing Python
As you may already know and might have heard this several times, one gets better at things by practising. Whilst following the learning resources, I practice/practised solving the challenges posted on the below websites:
- Programpiz challenges.
- Hackerrank Python challenges.
